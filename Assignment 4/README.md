# Simple Banking System

## What it shows
This project is a beginner-level demo of Python's Object-Oriented Programming.

### Concepts Used:
- **Class and init**: Used to create accounts and customers.
- **Encapsulation**: Balance is private using __balance.
- **Inheritance**: SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount come from BankAccount.
- **Method Overriding**: CheckingAccount has its own withdraw method.
- **Polymorphism**: Different accounts used in a single list.
- **Operator Overloading**: + used to merge two accounts.
- **Composition**: Customer "has-a" list of accounts.
- **Duck Typing**: print_account_summary() works on any object with `owner` and `balance`.

## Output includes:
- Deposits and withdrawals
- Applying interest
- Overdraft in checking
- Account merging
- Customer with total balance
- Duck typing on a Wallet class

### Notes:
- Easy to run and understand.
- Prints help explain each concept.
